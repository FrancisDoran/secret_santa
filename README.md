# Secret Santa with Festive Reveal ðŸŽ…

This project is a combination of a Secret Santa CLI script and a festive website for displaying results. Participants are randomly matched, ensuring no direct family members are paired. The result is revealed through an interactive website with a holiday-themed video and playlist.

---

## Features
- **CLI Script**: Generate Secret Santa pairings.
- **Web Interface**: A holiday-themed webpage for participants to retrieve their matches.
- **Interactive Video**: A present-unwrapping animation reveals the website.
- **Holiday Playlist**: Music automatically starts after the animation.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A web server to host the site (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or a local development server like Python's HTTP server).

---

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secret-santa.git
cd secret-santa
```

#### 2. Run the Secret Santa Script
Execute the CLI script to generate participant data:

```bash
python secret_santa.py
```

The script will guide you through:
- Adding participants and family units.
- Creating random pairings that avoid direct family members.
- Saving the generated data to `data/pairs.json`.

#### 3. Set Up the Website
- Copy the contents of the `website/` folder to your web server's root directory.
- Ensure the `data/pairs.json` file is accessible to the website.

#### 4. Host the Website
Use any web server to host the site. For quick testing, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server:
```bash
cd website
python -m http.server 8000
```
Visit the site in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Usage
1. **Run the Script**:
   - Use the CLI to generate participant data and save it in `data/pairs.json`.
2. **Distribute Keys**:
   - Each participant receives a unique key corresponding to their pairing.
3. **Visit the Website**:
   - Participants enter their keys on the website to reveal their matches.
